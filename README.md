# Rockbuster SQL Analysis Project

This project is part of Achievement 3 in my CareerFoundry Data Analytics program. I worked as a data analyst for a fictional company called Rockbuster Stealth LLC, a global movie rental business that is planning to move into online streaming to stay competitive with platforms like Netflix and Amazon Prime.

My role was to support Rockbuster’s Business Intelligence team by loading their data into a PostgreSQL database and using SQL to explore the data, understand the business, and answer key questions from different departments. The goal was to use SQL to uncover insights that would help shape the company’s strategy for launching their online video platform.

## Main Business Questions

### The Rockbuster Management Board wanted clear, data-driven answers to several strategic questions, including:

Which films generated the highest and lowest revenue?

What is the average rental duration across all movies?

Which countries do Rockbuster customers live in?

Where are high-value customers located?

Do sales differ across regions?

## Project Overview

### Throughout this achievement, I worked through SQL step-by-step, building from basic queries to more advanced techniques to answer these questions. The analysis covers tasks such as:

Exploring and understanding the database

Joining tables

Aggregating and summarizing data

Using subqueries and CTEs

Presenting results in a clear, visual way for management

The final output is a collection of queries and visualizations that explain the key patterns and opportunities for the business.

## Data

### The dataset includes Rockbuster’s:

Customers

Payments

Rental history

Film inventory

Product categories, staff, stores, and more

It’s a multi-table relational dataset (~3MB). I imported the data into PostgreSQL and explored the relationships between tables to structure the analysis.

## Deliverables

### Over the course of the exercises, I produced:

SQL queries that answer each business question

Visualizations and charts for management

A data dictionary

A final presentation summarizing insights and recommendations

## Skills Demonstrated

This project shows my ability to:

Write and interpret moderately complex SQL queries

Use SQL for business analysis

Present insights clearly to both technical and non-technical audiences

Work with relational databases and structured datasets
